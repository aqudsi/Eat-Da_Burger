This is an app made using node, Express, and sequelize to store burger orders in a SQL database. It's a fun app that allows users to create their own custom burgers, and then "devour them". The burger menu is shown on the left, and completed orders are shown on the left. Here is a link to the app: https://eat-da-burger-74394.herokuapp.com/
