This is an app made using node, Express, and sequelize to store burger orders in a SQL database. It's a fun app that allows users to create their own custom burgers, and then "devour them". Devoured burgers are shown on the right, and burgers ready to eat are shown on the left. Here is a link to the app: https://eat-da-burger-74394.herokuapp.com/
